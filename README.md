# Model Interpretability for Stock Data

This repository focuses on model interpretability for stock market data analysis. The objective is to run SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis on three distinct models: a linear model, a tree-based model, and a model generated using AutoML. By leveraging SHAP, we aim to gain insights into how these models make predictions and understand the importance of different features in predicting stock prices.

## Models

### 1. Linear Model

- **Model Type**: Linear Regression
- **Description**: Linear regression is a simple yet powerful model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. In the context of stock data analysis, this model attempts to predict stock prices using a linear combination of features.

### 2. Tree-Based Model

- **Model Type**: Random Forest (choose one)
- **Description**: Random forests are tree-based models that can capture non-linear relationships in data. These models are commonly used for regression tasks, making them suitable for predicting stock prices.

### 3. AutoML Model

- **Model Type**: AutoML Model (H2O)
- **Description**: AutoML automates the process of model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering. The AutoML-generated model represents an optimized and efficient model for stock price prediction.

## SHAP Analysis

### What is SHAP?

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a powerful framework for model interpretability. It helps us understand the contribution of each feature to the model's output, providing insights into how the model makes predictions.

### Why SHAP for Stock Data?

Understanding the factors influencing stock prices is crucial for investors and analysts. SHAP analysis can help us identify which features (e.g., trading volume, economic indicators) have the most significant impact on stock price predictions. This knowledge can inform investment decisions and risk assessments.
